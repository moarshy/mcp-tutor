This module has provided a foundational understanding of **MCP Communication Fundamentals**, equipping you with the essential knowledge to grasp how the Model Context Protocol facilitates seamless interaction between LLM applications and integrations.

We explored the core architecture of MCP, distinguishing between the **protocol layer** responsible for high-level communication patterns and the **transport layer** that handles the actual data exchange. You learned about the four primary **message types**—requests, results, errors, and notifications—and their roles in defining communication flows.

A key takeaway is the **lifecycle of an MCP connection**, from its initialization and subsequent message exchange to its eventual termination. We delved into the critical role of **transports** in MCP, specifically understanding how the **JSON-RPC 2.0 wire format** underpins all message exchanges. Furthermore, you can now distinguish between and apply the built-in **stdio** and **SSE transport implementations**, recognizing their suitability for different scenarios, whether local process communication or remote HTTP-based interactions.

With this comprehensive understanding of MCP's communication mechanisms, you are well-prepared to explore more advanced topics and effectively leverage the protocol in your LLM application development.
