This module provided a foundational understanding of the **Core MCP Primitives**, which are essential for enabling rich and secure interactions between LLMs, clients, and servers. We explored how **Resources** serve as the mechanism for servers to expose diverse data and content, providing crucial context for LLMs.

**Tools** were introduced as the means for LLMs to execute real-world actions and integrate with external systems through server-defined functions. We learned about **Prompts** as standardized, reusable templates that streamline and share LLM interaction patterns.

The **Sampling** feature was highlighted for its role in allowing servers to securely request LLM completions via the client, ensuring human oversight. Finally, we understood how **Roots** establish clear operational boundaries and define the relevant resources for servers.

Together, these primitives form the bedrock of the Model Context Protocol, empowering developers to build sophisticated and highly interactive LLM-powered applications by providing structured ways to manage context, actions, and interactions.
