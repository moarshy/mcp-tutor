## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions

1.  **b) To define the LLM's persona, behavior, or general instructions for the entire conversation.**
    *   *Explanation:* System messages set the overarching context and guidelines for the LLM's behavior throughout the interaction, influencing how it interprets user input and generates responses.

2.  **b) The smallest unit of text (e.g., a word, part of a word, or punctuation mark) that an LLM processes.**
    *   *Explanation:* LLMs don't process text character by character or word by word in the traditional sense. They break down input into tokens, which can be whole words, parts of words, or even punctuation, and these tokens are the fundamental units they operate on.

3.  **c) The limited amount of previous conversation history and input text that an LLM can consider at any given time.**
    *   *Explanation:* The context window is a crucial constraint, defining how much information (input prompt + conversation history + generated output) the model can "see" and process in a single turn. Exceeding it leads to truncation or errors.

4.  **c) `temperature`**
    *   *Explanation:* `temperature` is a sampling parameter that controls the randomness of the LLM's output. Higher temperatures lead to more diverse and creative (but potentially less coherent) responses, while lower temperatures make the output more deterministic and focused.

5.  **c) The application sends the relevant past user and assistant messages along with the new user query in each API call.**
    *   *Explanation:* LLMs are stateless by default. To maintain conversational memory, the application or client interacting with the LLM must explicitly send the history of previous turns (user and assistant messages) along with the current user's input in each new request.

### Section 2: Short Answer Questions

6.  **Explain the difference between a "user message" and an "assistant message" in the context of an LLM API call.**
    *   **User Message:** Represents the input or query provided by the human user to the LLM. It's what the user says or asks.
    *   **Assistant Message:** Represents the response or output generated by the LLM in reply to a user message. It's what the LLM says back.
    *   *Together, these form the turns of a conversation history sent to the LLM.*

7.  **Why is understanding "tokenization" important when designing LLM interactions, especially concerning context windows and cost?**
    *   Understanding tokenization is crucial because:
        *   **Context Window Limits:** LLMs have a fixed context window size measured in tokens. Knowing how text translates to tokens helps predict if a prompt or conversation history will fit within this limit, preventing truncation or errors.
        *   **Cost:** Most LLM APIs charge based on the number of tokens processed (both input and output). Being aware of token counts helps in estimating and managing API costs.
        *   **Efficiency:** It can influence prompt design to be more concise and efficient, optimizing both performance and cost.

8.  **Briefly describe two common strategies for managing the "context window" in long-running LLM conversations to prevent exceeding its limit.**
    *   **Truncation/Sliding Window:** Keep only the most recent N tokens or turns of the conversation history. When the context window is full, the oldest messages are removed to make space for new ones.
    *   **Summarization:** Periodically summarize older parts of the conversation and replace the detailed history with a concise summary. This reduces the token count while retaining key information.
    *   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Instead of sending the full history, use embeddings to retrieve only the most relevant past messages or external knowledge base entries related to the current query and include them in the prompt.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based Question

9.  **Scenario:** You are building a customer support chatbot using an LLM. The chatbot needs to:
    *   Always adopt a helpful and polite persona.
    *   Be able to answer questions about product features.
    *   Remember previous questions and answers within the same conversation to provide coherent follow-ups.
    *   Be able to summarize the conversation at the user's request.

    **Question:** Identify and explain which "core MCP primitives" (e.g., specific types of messages, parameters, or concepts) you would utilize to achieve each of the four requirements listed above.

    **Answer:**

    *   **Always adopt a helpful and polite persona:**
        *   **Primitive:** **System Message**
        *   **Explanation:** A `system` message at the beginning of the conversation (or as part of the initial prompt) would be used to instruct the LLM on its persona. For example: `"You are a helpful, polite, and friendly customer support assistant. Always maintain a positive and professional tone."` This sets the foundational behavior for the entire interaction.

    *   **Be able to answer questions about product features:**
        *   **Primitive:** **User Message (and potentially external data integration)**
        *   **Explanation:** The user's questions about product features would be sent as `user` messages. To ensure accurate answers, you might also integrate a knowledge base of product features. This could involve using embeddings to find relevant product information and then including that information directly in the `user` message (or a separate `system` or `tool` message) as context for the LLM to answer from.

    *   **Remember previous questions and answers within the same conversation to provide coherent follow-ups:**
        *   **Primitive:** **Conversation History (sequence of User and Assistant Messages)**
        *   **Explanation:** To maintain conversational memory, the application would need to store the sequence of `user` and `assistant` messages from previous turns. With each new user query, this entire (or truncated/summarized) history would be sent to the LLM as part of the `messages` array in the API call. This allows the LLM to "see" the context of the ongoing dialogue.

    *   **Be able to summarize the conversation at the user's request:**
        *   **Primitive:** **Prompt Engineering (specific instructions within a User Message) and Context Window Management**
        *   **Explanation:** When the user requests a summary, a new `user` message would be sent, explicitly instructing the LLM to summarize the current conversation. For example: `"Please summarize our conversation so far."` The LLM would then use the entire (or relevant portion of the) conversation history (which is managed within the context window) to generate the summary. This leverages the LLM's ability to process and condense information from its given context.
