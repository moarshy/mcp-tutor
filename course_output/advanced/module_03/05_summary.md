This module, "Core MCP Primitives: Enabling LLM Interactions," provides a foundational understanding of the essential building blocks within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that facilitate rich and secure interactions between LLMs, clients, and servers.

You have learned to:

*   **Define and differentiate between Resources, Tools, Prompts, Sampling, and Roots** within the MCP context. These five primitives are fundamental to how servers expose capabilities and data to clients for LLM consumption and action.
*   **Understand how Resources enable servers to expose various types of data and content to clients for LLM context.** Resources allow servers to provide structured or unstructured data, files, or other contextual information that LLMs can use to inform their responses.
*   **Learn how Tools allow LLMs to perform real-world actions and interact with external systems via server-exposed functions.** Tools bridge the gap between LLM reasoning and practical execution, enabling LLMs to call functions on the server to achieve tasks like fetching data, sending messages, or controlling applications.
*   **Comprehend the purpose of Prompts as reusable templates for standardizing and sharing LLM interactions.** Prompts ensure consistency and efficiency by providing pre-defined structures for common LLM queries, making it easier to manage and share interaction patterns.
*   **Understand how the Sampling feature enables servers to securely request LLM completions via the client with human oversight.** Sampling provides a mechanism for servers to leverage the client's access to LLMs, often incorporating user review or approval, ensuring secure and controlled generation of content.
*   **Explain how Roots define operational boundaries and relevant resources for servers.** Roots act as the entry points or scopes for servers, specifying which resources and capabilities are available within a particular operational context.

Together, these core MCP primitives form the backbone of the protocol, enabling a flexible, extensible, and secure framework for integrating LLMs into diverse applications and workflows.
