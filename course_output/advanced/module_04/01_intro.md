You've explored the foundational architecture of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), understanding how hosts, clients, and servers interact to power advanced LLM integrations. Now, it's time to shift from theory to practice. This module, "Building MCP Servers," is your hands-on guide to developing robust and efficient MCP servers that serve as the backbone for extending LLM capabilities.

As the providers of crucial context, tools, and prompt templates, MCP servers are at the heart of creating powerful and customized LLM experiences. Throughout this module, you will gain the practical skills necessary to:

*   **Set up your development environment** for building MCP servers, whether you prefer Python or Node.js.
*   **Implement core MCP functionalities**, including exposing custom Resources, defining and executing Tools, and creating dynamic Prompt Templates.
*   **Integrate sampling requests** from the server side to manage LLM interactions effectively.
*   **Apply best practices** for server-side message handling, robust error management, and essential security considerations, ensuring your servers are not only functional but also reliable and secure.
*   **Connect and test your custom MCP server** with an MCP host like Claude for Desktop, bringing your integrations to life.

By the end of this module, you will be equipped to design, build, and deploy your own custom MCP servers, significantly expanding the possibilities of your LLM applications within the MCP ecosystem.
