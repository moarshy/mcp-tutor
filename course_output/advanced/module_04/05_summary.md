This module, **Building MCP Servers**, provides a comprehensive guide to developing and deploying servers that adhere to the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:

*   **Set up a development environment** for building MCP servers using Python or Node.js.
*   **Implement an MCP server** capable of exposing various `Resources`, `Tools`, and `Prompts` to an MCP host.
*   **Integrate sampling requests** directly from the server side, enhancing dynamic content delivery.
*   **Apply best practices** for robust server-side message handling, comprehensive error management, and essential security measures.
*   **Connect and thoroughly test** your MCP server with an MCP host, such as Claude for Desktop, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.

The module delves into the core architecture of MCP, covering the protocol and transport layers (Stdio, HTTP with SSE), and the various message types (Requests, Results, Errors, Notifications). It emphasizes practical implementation, providing examples and detailing best practices for transport selection, efficient message processing, and secure server operation. You will also learn about crucial aspects like debugging, monitoring, and testing your server to ensure reliability and performance.
