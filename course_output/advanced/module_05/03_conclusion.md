This module provided a comprehensive guide to **building MCP clients**, equipping you with the essential knowledge and practical skills to develop robust applications within the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

You've learned how to:
*   **Set up your development environment** for MCP clients using both Python and Node.js.
*   **Implement effective server connection management**, understanding the lifecycle from initialization to termination.
*   **Develop core logic for processing user queries** and seamlessly interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Handle tool calls and integrate their results** into the LLM conversation flow, enhancing the capabilities of your client.
*   **Understand the sampling feature** and how clients request LLM completions, optimizing interaction with the models.

By mastering these aspects, you are now capable of creating clients that effectively communicate with MCP servers, leverage LLMs, and integrate external tools, all while adhering to best practices for security, error handling, and performance. This foundational understanding is crucial for developing powerful and interactive LLM applications.
