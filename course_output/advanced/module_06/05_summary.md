This module equips developers with essential skills for building robust, secure, and maintainable Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. You will learn to effectively **debug** MCP components using specialized tools like the MCP Inspector and Claude Desktop Developer Tools, alongside implementing comprehensive server-side and client-side **logging** for efficient monitoring and troubleshooting.

A significant focus is placed on **advanced error handling** strategies to ensure your MCP clients and servers can gracefully manage unexpected issues. Furthermore, the module delves into critical **security considerations**, covering best practices for transport security (e.g., TLS for remote connections), rigorous message validation, and robust resource protection through access controls and monitoring.

Finally, you will explore how to leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as powerful assistants in both the development and **testing** phases of custom MCP servers and clients, streamlining your workflow and enhancing code quality. Mastering these areas is crucial for deploying reliable and secure MCP solutions.
