Welcome to the foundational module of "Getting Started with Model Context Protocol (MCP): A Beginner's Guide to LLM Integration"!

In today's rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), the ability for these powerful models to interact seamlessly with external data, tools, and services is paramount. This is where the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** comes in.

This module, **Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, is your essential first step into understanding how LLM applications can effectively communicate with the outside world. We'll demystify the core concepts behind MCP, providing you with a solid foundation for building sophisticated LLM integrations.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   **Understand the fundamental purpose of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Why it exists and the problem it solves in LLM integration.
*   **Grasp the client-server architecture of MCP**: We'll explore the roles of **hosts** (your LLM applications), **clients**, and **servers** in establishing connections.
*   **Identify the core components of MCP communication**: Learn about the distinct responsibilities of the **protocol layer** and the **transport layer**.
*   **Recognize the basic message types and connection lifecycle in MCP**: Understand how requests, responses, and notifications flow, and the stages a connection goes through from initialization to termination.

This module sets the stage for the entire course, equipping you with the conceptual framework necessary to dive deeper into the practical aspects of MCP in subsequent modules. Let's begin our journey into seamless LLM integration!
