This module provided a foundational introduction to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a crucial framework for enabling seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations.

We explored MCP's core purpose, understanding how it facilitates the exchange of context, tools, and prompts. A key takeaway was grasping its **client-server architecture**, where **hosts** (LLM applications) contain **clients** that establish 1:1 connections with **servers**.

You learned about the essential components that underpin MCP communication: the **protocol layer**, responsible for high-level message patterns and framing, and the **transport layer**, which handles the actual data exchange using mechanisms like Stdio and HTTP with SSE, all built upon JSON-RPC 2.0. We also covered the basic **message types** (requests, results, errors, notifications) and the typical **connection lifecycle**, from initialization through message exchange to termination.

With this understanding, you are now equipped with the fundamental concepts necessary to delve deeper into the intricacies of the Model Context Protocol.
