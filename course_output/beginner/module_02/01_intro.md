Welcome to **Module 1: Core MCP Primitives: Context, Actions, and Interaction**!

In the broader landscape of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we've established that it's a powerful architecture designed to facilitate seamless communication between LLM applications (Hosts), clients, and servers. At its heart, MCP empowers LLMs to not just understand information, but to actively engage with the world by providing context and enabling actions.

This module is your essential starting point, diving deep into the fundamental building blocks that make this interaction possible. We'll explore the core primitives that servers use to expose data, enable LLMs to perform real-world operations, standardize interactions, define operational boundaries, and ensure secure completions.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   **Define and differentiate** between MCP Resources, Tools, Prompts, Roots, and Sampling.
*   **Understand how servers use Resources** to provide rich, dynamic context to LLMs.
*   **Learn how Tools enable LLMs** to perform real-world actions, always with appropriate user approval.
*   **Comprehend the vital role of Prompts** in standardizing and guiding LLM interactions for consistent and effective outcomes.
*   **Understand how Roots define** the operational boundaries and scope for servers, ensuring secure and controlled environments.
*   **Grasp the concept of Sampling** for secure and controlled LLM completions, managed via the client.

Mastering these core primitives is crucial. They are the bedrock upon which all more complex MCP integrations are built, setting you up for success in the subsequent modules of this "Getting Started with Model Context Protocol (MCP)" course. Let's begin!
