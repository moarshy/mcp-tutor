This module provided a foundational understanding of the Model Context Protocol's (MCP) core primitives, which are essential for enabling sophisticated interactions between clients, servers, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

We explored:
*   **Resources:** How servers leverage these to provide rich, dynamic context to LLMs, forming the basis of their understanding.
*   **Tools:** The mechanism by which LLMs can perform real-world actions, always with explicit user approval, extending their capabilities beyond mere text generation.
*   **Prompts:** The standardized structures that guide and constrain LLM interactions, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior.
*   **Roots:** The critical concept defining the operational boundaries and permissions for servers, enhancing security and control.
*   **Sampling:** The client-side process that ensures secure and controlled LLM completions, safeguarding sensitive information.

By understanding these core primitives—Resources for context, Tools for actions, Prompts for interaction, Roots for boundaries, and Sampling for security—you now grasp the fundamental building blocks that empower MCP to facilitate robust, secure, and highly functional LLM applications. These primitives are the bedrock upon which the entire MCP architecture is built, enabling seamless and controlled communication within the LLM ecosystem.
