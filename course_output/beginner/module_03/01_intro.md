Welcome to **Module 2: MCP Communication: Message Formats and Transports**!

In the previous module, we gained a high-level understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) core architecture, including the roles of clients, servers, and the fundamental concept of the transport layer. Now, we'll dive deeper into the actual mechanics of how MCP clients and servers communicate.

This module is crucial for anyone looking to build robust and efficient MCP integrations. We will demystify the underlying mechanisms that enable seamless message exchange, focusing on two key aspects:

1.  **The JSON-RPC Message Format:** MCP leverages JSON-RPC 2.0 as its standard for structuring messages. You'll learn about the different types of messages exchanged—requests, responses (including successful results and errors), and notifications—and how they facilitate the protocol's operations.
2.  **Built-in Transport Types:** We'll explore the two primary transport implementations provided by MCP:
    *   **Stdio Transport:** Ideal for local, inter-process communication, utilizing standard input/output streams.
    *   **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Transport:** A robust option for web-based or remote communication, leveraging HTTP for client-to-server messages and SSE for server-to-client messages.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the fundamental role of transports in facilitating MCP communication.
*   Identify and differentiate between the various JSON-RPC message types used by MCP, including requests, responses, and notifications.
*   Gain practical knowledge of the built-in Stdio and SSE transport implementations.
*   Determine the appropriate use cases for both Stdio and SSE transports based on your application's requirements.

Let's begin by unraveling the intricacies of MCP's communication backbone!
