You've explored the foundational concepts and architectural components of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), understanding how clients, servers, and LLMs interact. Now, it's time to move from theory to practice and build your very first MCP server!

This module, **"Building Your First MCP Server,"** is your hands-on guide to creating the server-side capabilities that power seamless LLM integrations. We'll focus on setting up a Python development environment and then progressively build a simple MCP server capable of exposing custom tools to an MCP client.

By the end of this practical module, you will be able to:

*   **Set up a Python development environment** specifically configured for building MCP servers.
*   **Understand the basic structure and core capabilities** of an MCP server, including how it communicates and manages resources.
*   **Implement simple tools** within your MCP server, demonstrating how to extend LLM functionality.
*   **Connect your newly built MCP server** to an MCP client, such as Claude for Desktop, to see your tools in action.

Prepare to write code and bring the MCP architecture to life as you create a tangible piece of the LLM integration puzzle!
