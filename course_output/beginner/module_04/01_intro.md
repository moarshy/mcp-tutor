Welcome to **Module 3: Building Your First MCP Server**!

In the previous module, you gained a foundational understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture, including its core components like clients, servers, and the underlying transport and protocol layers. You now know *what* an MCP server is and *how* it generally fits into the ecosystem.

Now, it's time to get hands-on. This module is your practical guide to bringing that theoretical knowledge to life. You'll move from understanding concepts to actively building a functional MCP server from the ground up.

**What you will learn and do in this module:**

*   **Set up your Python development environment** specifically tailored for building MCP servers.
*   **Understand the basic structure and capabilities** of a simple MCP server, seeing how it interacts with clients.
*   **Implement simple tools** within your MCP server, demonstrating how it can expose functionalities to LLMs.
*   **Connect your newly built MCP server** to an MCP client, such as Claude for Desktop, to see your server in action.

By the end of this module, you will have successfully built and run your very first MCP server, laying the essential groundwork for creating more complex and powerful LLM integrations. Let's get started!
