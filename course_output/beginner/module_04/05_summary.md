This module, "Building Your First MCP Server," provides a practical guide to getting started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) from a server development perspective. You will learn how to set up a Python development environment specifically tailored for building MCP servers, understanding that MCP operates on a client-server architecture where your server provides context, tools, and prompts to clients within a host application like Claude for Desktop.

A core focus is on understanding the basic structure and capabilities of an MCP server. This includes grasping the roles of the protocol and transport layers, the different message types (requests, results, errors, notifications), and the connection lifecycle (initialization, message exchange, termination). You will then apply this knowledge to implement simple tools within your MCP server, defining how it handles incoming requests and sends responses or notifications. Finally, the module guides you through the process of connecting your newly built MCP server to an MCP client, such as Claude for Desktop, demonstrating the end-to-end communication flow. By the end of this module, you will have a functional understanding and practical experience in building your first MCP server.
