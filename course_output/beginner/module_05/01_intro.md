Welcome to **Module 4: Interacting with MCP: Client-Side Development & Usage**.

In the previous modules, you gained a foundational understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its core architecture, including the crucial client-server relationship. You learned that MCP clients are the applications or "hosts" that initiate connections and interact with MCP servers to leverage their context, tools, and prompts.

This module shifts our focus to the practical application of that knowledge from the client's perspective. We will explore two key aspects of interacting with MCP:

1.  **Using Pre-built MCP Clients:** Discover how to configure and extend existing applications, such as Claude Desktop, to seamlessly integrate with and benefit from MCP servers. You'll learn how to unlock new capabilities by connecting these applications to local or remote MCP servers.
2.  **Developing Custom MCP Clients:** Dive into the exciting world of building your own LLM-powered chatbot clients. We'll guide you through setting up development environments in popular languages like Python and Node.js, and then walk you through the essential steps of implementing basic client-server connection and query processing logic. This will empower you to create bespoke applications that leverage the power of MCP.

By the end of this module, you will not only be proficient in utilizing existing MCP-enabled applications but also possess the foundational skills to develop your own custom clients, truly harnessing the flexibility and power of the Model Context Protocol.
