This module provided a comprehensive guide to **Interacting with MCP: Client-Side Development & Usage**. We delved into the practicalities of connecting to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) from the client perspective, equipping you with essential skills for building and extending LLM applications.

Key takeaways from this module include:

*   **Configuring Claude Desktop** to seamlessly utilize pre-built MCP servers, enhancing its capabilities.
*   Understanding the power of **extending Claude Desktop's functionality** by integrating with your own local MCP servers.
*   Setting up a robust **development environment** for crafting custom MCP clients in popular languages like Python and Node.js.
*   Implementing the fundamental **client-server connection and query processing logic**, which forms the backbone of MCP communication.

By mastering these concepts, you are now empowered to develop custom MCP clients that can provide rich context, tools, and prompts to host applications. This knowledge is crucial for leveraging MCP's flexible architecture to create powerful, tailored integrations for your LLM workflows.
