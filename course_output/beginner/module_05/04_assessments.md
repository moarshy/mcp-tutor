### Section 1: Core Concepts (Multiple Choice & Short Answer)

**Question 1: Communication Methods**
Which of the following are common methods for a client-side application (e.g., a web browser application) to interact with a backend system like MCP? (Select all that apply)
A) RESTful APIs (HTTP/HTTPS)
B) Direct database access
C) WebSockets
D) FTP
E) Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Answer:** A, C, E
*   **A) RESTful APIs (HTTP/HTTPS):** This is the most common method for client-server communication, using standard HTTP methods.
*   **B) Direct database access:** Client-side applications typically do not directly access databases for security and architectural reasons. They interact via an API layer.
*   **C) WebSockets:** Used for full-duplex, persistent communication, ideal for real-time applications.
*   **D) FTP:** Primarily used for file transfer, not for general application data exchange.
*   **E) Server-Sent Events (SSE):** Used for one-way communication from the server to the client, often for real-time updates.

**Question 2: RESTful API Operations**
If MCP exposes a RESTful API, describe the typical HTTP methods used for the following operations on a resource (e.g., `/users`):
*   Retrieving a list of users:
*   Creating a new user:
*   Updating an existing user:
*   Deleting a user:

**Answer:**
*   **Retrieving a list of users:** `GET` (e.g., `GET /users`)
*   **Creating a new user:** `POST` (e.g., `POST /users`)
*   **Updating an existing user:** `PUT` or `PATCH` (e.g., `PUT /users/{id}` or `PATCH /users/{id}`)
    *   `PUT` is typically for full replacement of a resource.
    *   `PATCH` is for partial updates.
*   **Deleting a user:** `DELETE` (e.g., `DELETE /users/{id}`)

**Question 3: Authentication Mechanisms**
When a client-side application needs to authenticate with MCP, what are two common authentication mechanisms used to secure API calls? Briefly explain one of them.

**Answer:**
Two common authentication mechanisms are:
1.  **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:** An authorization framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to an HTTP service. It involves concepts like authorization servers, resource servers, client IDs, client secrets, authorization codes, and access tokens.
2.  **API Keys:** A simple token that a client provides when making API requests. It's often passed in the request header or as a query parameter. While simple, it's less secure than OAuth 2.0 for user authentication as it typically identifies the application, not the user.
3.  **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are often used in conjunction with OAuth 2.0 or as a standalone token for stateless authentication, where the token itself contains user information and is signed to prevent tampering.

*Explanation Example (OAuth 2.0):*
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables an application to obtain limited access to a user's account on an HTTP service (like MCP). Instead of giving the client application the user's credentials, the user authorizes the application to access their information. The process typically involves the client redirecting the user to an authorization server, where the user grants permission. The authorization server then issues an authorization code to the client, which the client exchanges for an access token. This access token is then used by the client to make authenticated requests to the MCP API on behalf of the user.

**Question 4: Data Exchange Formats**
What data format is predominantly used for exchanging data between client-side applications (especially web-based) and backend systems like MCP? Provide a small example of this format representing a user with a name and email.

**Answer:**
**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is the predominant data format.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "user123",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice.smith@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Section 2: Advanced Topics & Best Practices (Short Answer)

**Question 5: Asynchronous Operations**
Why is it crucial for client-side applications to use asynchronous operations (e.g., Promises, async/await in JavaScript) when interacting with a remote system like MCP?

**Answer:**
It is crucial because network requests to a remote system like MCP are inherently **time-consuming** and **unpredictable**. If these operations were synchronous, the client-side application's user interface (UI) would **freeze or become unresponsive** while waiting for the response from MCP. Asynchronous operations allow the application to:
1.  **Maintain Responsiveness:** The UI thread is not blocked, allowing users to continue interacting with the application while the network request is in progress.
2.  **Improve User Experience:** Prevents the application from appearing "stuck" and provides a smoother, more fluid experience.
3.  **Handle Delays Gracefully:** Allows for the implementation of loading indicators, progress bars, and timeouts, improving the perceived performance.

**Question 6: Error Handling**
Describe at least three common strategies for handling errors when making API calls to MCP from the client-side.

**Answer:**
Common strategies for handling errors include:
1.  **Checking HTTP Status Codes:** The first line of defense. Client-side code should check the HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) returned by MCP. Different status codes indicate different types of issues (client-side errors, server-side errors, authentication issues, etc.), allowing for specific error handling logic.
2.  **Parsing Error Responses:** MCP's API should ideally return a structured error response (e.g., JSON) containing details like an error code, a human-readable message, and possibly specific field validation errors. The client-side application should parse this response to display meaningful error messages to the user or log detailed information for debugging.
3.  **Implementing Retry Mechanisms:** For transient network issues or server-side errors (e.g., 5xx status codes), a client-side application can implement a retry mechanism, often with an exponential backoff strategy, to automatically re-attempt the request after a short delay. This improves resilience.
4.  **User Feedback and Fallbacks:** Informing the user about the error (e.g., "Failed to load data, please try again later"), providing options to retry, or displaying cached/fallback data if available.
5.  **Logging and Monitoring:** Sending error details to a client-side logging service or analytics platform to track issues and identify patterns, aiding in debugging and improving the API or client application.

**Question 7: Security Considerations**
List two critical security considerations for client-side applications interacting with MCP, especially in a web browser environment.

**Answer:**
Two critical security considerations are:
1.  **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** If the client-side application is hosted on a different domain, port, or protocol than MCP's API, the browser's same-origin policy will block requests. MCP must be configured to send appropriate CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to allow the client's domain to access its resources. Without proper CORS configuration, client-side requests will fail.
2.  **Protection against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**
    *   **XSS:** Client-side applications must sanitize any user-generated content before rendering it to prevent malicious scripts from being injected and executed in the user's browser, which could steal credentials or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **CSRF:** Client-side applications (and MCP) should implement CSRF protection (e.g., using CSRF tokens) to ensure that requests originating from the client are legitimate and not forged by a malicious third-party site.
3.  **Secure Handling of Sensitive Data/Credentials:** Client-side applications should never store sensitive information like API keys, user passwords, or private tokens directly in client-side code or local storage where they can be easily accessed. Authentication tokens (like JWTs) should be stored securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies) and transmitted over HTTPS.
4.  **HTTPS/SSL/TLS:** All communication between the client and MCP should occur over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Section 3: Practical Application (Code Snippet)

**Question 8: Fetching Data**
You need to fetch a list of products from MCP's API at the endpoint `https://api.mcp.com/products`. The API requires an `Authorization` header with a Bearer token (e.g., `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`). Write a JavaScript code snippet using the `fetch` API to retrieve this data and log it to the console. Include basic error handling.

**Answer:**

```javascript
async function fetchProductsFromMCP() {
  const accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'; // In a real app, this would be securely obtained

  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.mcp.com/products', {
      method: 'GET', // GET is default, but good to be explicit
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Inform server we expect JSON, though GET might not send body
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
      }
    });

    // Check if the response was successful (status code 200-299)
    if (!response.ok) {
      // Handle HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error)
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({ message: 'Unknown error format' }));
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}, Message: ${errorData.message || response.statusText}`);
    }

    const products = await response.json(); // Parse the JSON response body
    console.log('Products fetched successfully:', products);
    return products;

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch products from MCP:', error.message);
    // Optionally, display an error message to the user
    // alert('Could not load products. Please try again later.');
    return null; // Or throw the error further
  }
}

// Example usage:
fetchProductsFromMCP();
```
