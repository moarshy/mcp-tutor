This module, "Interacting with MCP: Client-Side Development & Usage," provides a comprehensive guide to building and utilizing Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients. You will learn how to configure applications like Claude Desktop to connect with both pre-built and locally developed MCP servers, significantly extending their functionality.

Key learning outcomes include:
*   Setting up a development environment for creating MCP clients using Python or Node.js.
*   Implementing the fundamental logic for client-server connections and query processing.
*   Understanding how to leverage MCP's client-server architecture to enhance LLM applications.

By the end of this module, you will be equipped to develop robust MCP clients that seamlessly interact within the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.
