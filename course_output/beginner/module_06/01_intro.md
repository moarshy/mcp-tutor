Building robust integrations with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) involves understanding its intricate client-server architecture, message types, and communication patterns. As you've learned, MCP facilitates seamless interaction between LLM applications and your custom servers. However, even with a well-designed protocol, the reality of development often involves encountering unexpected behaviors, communication errors, or subtle bugs.

This module is dedicated to equipping you with the essential tools and best practices to navigate these challenges effectively. We'll move beyond theoretical understanding to practical application, focusing on how to diagnose, debug, and resolve issues within your MCP integrations. You'll discover how to leverage powerful diagnostic tools like the **MCP Inspector** for interactive server testing and the **Claude Desktop Developer Tools** for in-depth client-side debugging and log analysis. By the end of this module, you'll be proficient in identifying common integration pitfalls and applying systematic approaches to ensure your MCP solutions are stable, reliable, and perform as expected.
