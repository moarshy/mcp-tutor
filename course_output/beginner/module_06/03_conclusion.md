This module has equipped you with essential knowledge and practical skills for debugging and developing robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. We explored the critical role of various debugging tools, including the **MCP Inspector** for interactive server testing and the **Claude Desktop Developer Tools** for comprehensive log viewing and client-side debugging. By understanding how to effectively utilize these resources, you are now better prepared to identify, diagnose, and resolve common issues that may arise during the development lifecycle. Mastering these debugging and development practices is fundamental to ensuring the stability, performance, and reliability of your MCP applications, ultimately contributing to a seamless and efficient interaction between clients, servers, and LLMs.
