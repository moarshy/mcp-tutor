This module marks the conclusion of our deep dive into the Model Context Protocol (MCP) core architecture. Throughout this documentation, you've gained a comprehensive understanding of how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs, exploring its fundamental components, communication patterns, and best practices.

You should now feel confident in your grasp of:
*   **MCP's Architecture**: The roles of hosts, clients, and servers, and how they interact.
*   **Protocol and Transport Layers**: The mechanisms enabling robust and flexible communication.
*   **Message Primitives**: The structure and purpose of requests, results, errors, and notifications.
*   **Connection Lifecycle**: From initialization to termination, and effective error handling.

With this foundational knowledge, you are well-equipped to embark on your own MCP projects. We encourage you to leverage the provided examples, explore the official specifications, and engage with the MCP community to further your learning and contribute to the ecosystem.
