  "title": "Mastering MCP: Building & Integrating LLM Applications with Model Context Protocol",
  "description": "Unlock the power of seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This intermediate-level learning path provides a comprehensive deep dive into MCP's flexible, extensible client-server architecture. You'll start by understanding the core concepts, including context management and action execution, before progressing to advanced topics like client-server interaction patterns, transport layers (Stdio, HTTP with SSE), and message types (requests, notifications, errors).\n\nThrough practical examples and best practices, you will learn how to design, implement, and deploy robust MCP servers and clients. The course covers essential development workflows, including debugging, error handling, and performance monitoring. Furthermore, you'll explore critical considerations for secure and scalable deployments, ensuring your MCP-based solutions are production-ready. By the end of this path, you'll be equipped to confidently build, integrate, and troubleshoot sophisticated LLM applications using the Model Context Protocol.",
