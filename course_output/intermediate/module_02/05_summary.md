This module, "Core MCP Capabilities: Context and Actions," delves into the fundamental features of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable LLMs to understand their environment and perform actions.

You learned about:

*   **Resources**: How they represent and expose data within MCP, providing crucial context to LLMs. This includes understanding their structure, purpose, and the role of Resource URIs and types in uniquely identifying and categorizing data.
*   **Tools**: The mechanism by which LLMs can execute actions. You explored the purpose and role of Tools, how they are defined, discovered by clients, and invoked to extend the capabilities of LLMs beyond simple text generation.
*   **Prompts**: Their significance in guiding LLM behavior and shaping responses. The module covered the structural components of Prompts and the process by which clients discover and effectively utilize available Prompts.
*   **Sampling**: The MCP feature designed for generating messages. You gained an understanding of the Sampling workflow and the specific components and parameters involved in a `sampling/createMessage` request.

By mastering these core capabilities—Resources for context, Tools for action, Prompts for guidance, and Sampling for generation—you now have a comprehensive understanding of how MCP empowers LLMs to interact dynamically and intelligently within their host applications.
