# Module 4: Building MCP Servers: Quickstart & Best Practices

Welcome to Module 4 of "Mastering MCP: Building & Integrating LLM Applications with Model Context Protocol"! Having explored the foundational architecture of MCP in previous modules, including how **Hosts**, **Clients**, and **Servers** interact, it's now time to transition from theory to hands-on implementation.

This module is your practical quickstart guide to building your very first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. As you learned, MCP servers are crucial components in the ecosystem, responsible for providing valuable context, tools, and prompts to LLM applications like Claude for Desktop. By the end of this module, you won't just understand what an MCP server is; you'll have built one yourself.

Throughout this module, you will:

*   **Understand the basic architecture and capabilities of an MCP server**, solidifying your grasp of how it fits into the broader MCP ecosystem.
*   **Identify the core types of capabilities an MCP server can provide**, specifically focusing on resources, tools, and prompts.
*   **Set up a Python development environment** tailored for building MCP servers, ensuring you have all the necessary prerequisites.
*   **Begin building a simple MCP server that exposes tools**, walking through the code step-by-step to create functional server logic.
*   **Connect your MCP server to an MCP client like Claude for Desktop**, seeing your server in action and understanding the client-server interaction firsthand.

Get ready to dive into the code and bring your first MCP server to life!
