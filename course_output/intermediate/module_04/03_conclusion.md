This module, **Module 4: Building MCP Servers: Quickstart & Best Practices**, has provided a foundational understanding and practical guide to developing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. We began by exploring the basic architecture and diverse capabilities of an MCP server, recognizing its role in exposing resources, tools, and prompts to LLM applications.

You gained hands-on experience by setting up a Python development environment and embarking on the journey of building a simple MCP server that exposes essential tools. Crucially, you learned how to connect your newly built MCP server to an MCP client, such as Claude for Desktop, demonstrating the seamless integration within the MCP ecosystem.

Beyond the quickstart, this module emphasized the importance of **best practices** in server development, including judicious transport selection (stdio for local, SSE for remote), robust message handling, and effective error management. We also delved into critical **security considerations**, covering transport security, message validation, resource protection, and secure error handling, ensuring your MCP servers are not only functional but also resilient and secure. By mastering these concepts, you are now equipped to build powerful, well-integrated, and secure MCP servers.
