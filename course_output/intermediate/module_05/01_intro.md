Welcome to **Module 5: Building MCP Clients: Integration & Interaction**!

In the previous modules, you gained a foundational understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its core architecture, including the roles of clients, servers, and hosts. You learned that MCP facilitates seamless communication between LLM applications and various integrations, with clients playing a crucial role in initiating and maintaining connections with MCP servers.

This module shifts our focus from theory to practical application. You will step into the shoes of a client developer and learn how to build an LLM-powered chatbot client capable of integrating directly with MCP servers. We'll guide you through the essential steps, from setting up your development environment to configuring API keys and implementing the fundamental code structure for managing connections and processing queries.

To ensure broad applicability, this module provides comprehensive guidance for both **Python** and **Node.js/TypeScript** environments. By the end of this module, you will be equipped to:

*   Set up your development environment for building MCP clients in both Python and Node.js.
*   Configure and integrate necessary API keys, such as Anthropic, into your client projects.
*   Understand and implement the basic structure for managing connections to MCP servers.
*   Develop a functional LLM-powered chatbot client that leverages the Model Context Protocol for interaction and context exchange.

Get ready to transform your understanding into tangible, interactive applications!
