Welcome to **Module 5: Building MCP Clients: Integration & Interaction**!

In the previous modules, you've gained a foundational understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its core architectural components, including how clients, servers, and LLMs interact. Now, it's time to put that knowledge into practice by building your own MCP client.

This module is designed for client developers who want to create an LLM-powered chatbot client capable of seamlessly integrating with MCP servers. You'll learn the essential steps, from setting up your development environment and configuring API keys to implementing the fundamental code structure for managing connections and processing queries. We'll provide practical guidance and examples in both Python and Node.js, allowing you to choose the language that best suits your needs.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Set up a Python development environment for an MCP client.
*   Configure an Anthropic API key for client use.
*   Understand the basic structure of an MCP client and implement server connection management.
*   Build an LLM-powered chatbot client using MCP.
*   Set up a Node.js development environment for an MCP client.
*   Install and configure necessary SDKs and dependencies for an MCP client.
*   Integrate an Anthropic API key into a Node.js project.
*   Understand the basic structure for creating an MCP client in TypeScript.

Get ready to transform your theoretical understanding into practical application as we build interactive and intelligent LLM clients with MCP!
