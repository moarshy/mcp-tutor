This module, **"Building MCP Clients: Integration & Interaction,"** has provided you with the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary to develop robust clients for the Model Context Protocol.

You successfully navigated the setup of dedicated development environments for both **Python** and **Node.js**, laying the groundwork for your client projects. A crucial step involved securely configuring and integrating **Anthropic API keys**, enabling your clients to harness the power of large language models.

You gained a deep understanding of the basic structure of an MCP client, mastering the essential techniques for **server connection management**. This theoretical knowledge was then put into practice as you built a functional **LLM-powered chatbot client**, demonstrating the real-world application of MCP.

By completing this module, you are now equipped to design, implement, and integrate your own MCP clients, effectively connecting them within the broader MCP ecosystem to create sophisticated, LLM-driven applications.
