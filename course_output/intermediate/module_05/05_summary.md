Module 5, "Building MCP Clients: Integration & Interaction," provides a comprehensive guide for developers to create robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients. This module focuses on the practical steps required to set up development environments in both Python and Node.js/TypeScript, including the installation of necessary SDKs and the configuration of external APIs like Anthropic. Learners will gain a deep understanding of the fundamental structure of an MCP client, covering essential aspects such as managing server connections and handling message exchanges. A key highlight is the hands-on experience of building an LLM-powered chatbot client, demonstrating how to seamlessly integrate large language models within the MCP framework. By the end of this module, developers will be equipped to design, implement, and interact with MCP servers, enabling the creation of sophisticated LLM-driven applications.
