Welcome to Module 6: Debugging and Development Workflow. As you progress in building sophisticated integrations with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), understanding how to effectively diagnose and resolve issues becomes paramount. The MCP, as you've learned, facilitates seamless communication between LLM applications and your integrations through a robust client-server architecture, making efficient debugging a critical skill for any developer.

In this module, we'll equip you with the essential tools and techniques to troubleshoot your MCP integrations efficiently. We'll dive deep into practical debugging strategies, exploring powerful utilities like the **MCP Inspector** and leveraging the **Claude Desktop Developer Tools** to gain insights into client-side behavior and network activity. You'll learn how to interpret detailed logs, identify common configuration pitfalls related to server working directories and environment variables, and master the art of effective problem-solving.

By the end of this module, you'll not only be able to pinpoint and resolve issues quickly but also integrate these debugging practices into a streamlined development workflow, ensuring your MCP integrations are robust, reliable, and perform as expected.
