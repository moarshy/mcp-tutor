This module has equipped you with essential skills and tools for debugging and optimizing your Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. You've learned to navigate the debugging landscape, from leveraging built-in features in Claude Desktop to inspecting client-side behavior with Chrome DevTools. Crucially, you now understand how to diagnose and resolve common server-side issues, including those related to working directories and environment variables.

A significant focus was placed on the MCP Inspector, a powerful dedicated tool that allows you to connect to various MCP server types (NPM, PyPi, local) and gain deep insights into server resources, prompts, and tools. Mastering the MCP Inspector is vital for effective testing and debugging, ensuring your MCP servers function as expected.

By understanding these debugging methodologies and utilizing the provided tools, you are now better prepared to identify, troubleshoot, and resolve issues efficiently, leading to more robust and reliable MCP integrations within the broader client-server architecture.
