This module, "Debugging and Development Workflow," equipped you with essential skills and tools to efficiently troubleshoot and optimize your Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. You learned to leverage various debugging utilities, starting with the built-in capabilities of Claude Desktop to check MCP server status and review detailed logs. The module also covered using Chrome DevTools for inspecting client-side errors and network activity within Claude Desktop, crucial for diagnosing front-end related issues.

A significant focus was placed on identifying and resolving common MCP integration challenges, such as those related to server working directories and environment variable inheritance. Furthermore, you gained hands-on experience with the powerful MCP Inspector tool, learning how to install and connect it to different types of MCP servers (NPM, PyPi, local). You mastered using the MCP Inspector's interface to thoroughly inspect server resources, prompts, and tools, making it an invaluable asset for comprehensive testing and debugging of your MCP servers. By mastering these techniques, you are now better prepared to maintain robust and reliable MCP integrations.
