This module, "Advanced Development & Deployment Considerations," has equipped you with the essential knowledge and practical skills to elevate your Model Context Protocol (MCP) development.

You've learned how to effectively **prepare documentation and describe server requirements** to an LLM, transforming it into a powerful collaborator for building and testing MCP components. A key focus was understanding the **purpose and configuration of MCP Servers** within Claude Desktop, including the practical steps of locating and editing configuration files, and setting up specific server types like the Filesystem MCP Server to manage access to directories.

By mastering these advanced considerations, you are now better prepared to develop, deploy, and maintain robust, secure, and efficient MCP integrations, leveraging the full potential of LLMs as intelligent development partners.
