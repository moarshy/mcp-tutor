This module, "Advanced Development & Deployment Considerations," equips you with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the more intricate aspects of Model Context Protocol (MCP) development and deployment. You will learn how to effectively prepare documentation and describe server requirements to an LLM, fostering efficient collaboration for building and testing MCP components. Furthermore, the module provides practical guidance on understanding MCP Servers from a user's perspective within host applications like Claude Desktop, including how to locate and edit configuration files to add and configure pre-built MCP servers, such as the Filesystem MCP Server, for specific directory access. This module bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application, preparing you for real-world MCP integration and deployment challenges.
