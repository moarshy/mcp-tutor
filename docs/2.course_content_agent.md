# Documentation-to-Course Agent: Conceptual Design Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the conceptual architecture for building an LLM agent that transforms technical documentation repositories into structured learning courses. The system follows the **Pedagogical Agents** framework from recent research, combining **Learning Resource Recommendation (LRR)** and **Adaptive Learning (AL)** capabilities using DSPy for implementation.

## Project Overview

### Objective

- Generates structured courses with proper sequencing and assessment

### Key Features
- Repository structure preservation
- Intelligent concept extraction and relationship mapping
- Three-tier learning pathway generation
- Automated course content organization
- Assessment and exercise generation
